# Exercise 12

Note that one advantage of the OOP approach is that an entire class can be used, without modification, in a different program. Use the `fraction` class from Exercise 11 in a program that generates a multiplication table for fractions. Let the user input a denominator, and then generate all combinations of two such fractions that are between 0 and 1, and multiply them together. Hereâ€™s an example of the output if the denominator is 6:

           1/6     1/3     1/2     2/3    5/6
    --------------------------------------------
    1/6    1/36    1/18    1/12    1/9    5/36
    1/3    1/18    1/9     1/6     2/9    5/18
    1/2    1/12    1/6     1/4     1/3    5/12
    2/3    1/9     2/9     1/3     4/9    5/9
    5/6    5/36    5/18    5/12    5/9    25/36
