# Exercise 11

Create a three-function calculator for old-style English currency, where money amounts are specified in pounds, shillings, and pence. (See Exercises 10 and 12 in Chapter 2.) The calculator should allow the user to add or subtract two money amounts, or to multiply a money amount by a floating-point number. (It doesn’t make sense to multiply two money amounts; there is no such thing as square money. We’ll ignore division. Use the general style of the ordinary four-function calculator in Exercise 4 in this chapter.)
