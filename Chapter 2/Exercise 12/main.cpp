/*Write the inverse of Exercise 10, so that the user enters an amount in Great Britain's new
decimal-pounds notation (pounds and pence), and the program converts it to the old
pounds-shillings-pence notation. 
An example of interaction with the program might be
Enter decimal pounds: 3.51
Equivalent in old notation = Â£3.10.2.
Make use of the fact that if you assign a floating-point value (say 12.34) to an integer
variable, the decimal fraction (0.34) is lost; the integer value is simply 12. Use a cast to
avoid a compiler warning. You can use statements like
    float decpounds; // input from user (new-style pounds)
    int pounds; // old-style (integer) pounds
    float decfrac; // decimal fraction (smaller than 1.0)
    pounds = static_cast<int>(decpounds); // remove decimal fraction
        decfrac = decpounds - pounds; // regain decimal fraction
You can then multiply decfrac by 20 to find shillings. A similar operation obtains pence.*/
