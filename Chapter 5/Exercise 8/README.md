# Exercise 8

Write a function called `swap()` that interchanges two `int` values passed to it by the calling program. (Note that this function swaps the values of the variables in the calling program, not those in the function.) Youâ€™ll need to decide how to pass the arguments. Create a `main()` program to exercise the function.
