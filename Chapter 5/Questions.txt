Write a main() program that includes everything necessary to call this function.
int main(){
 	int times2(int); 
	alpha = times2(37);
	return 0; 
}




18. When an argument is passed by reference
[ ] a. a variable is created in the function to hold the argument’s value.
[ ] b. the function cannot access the argument’s value.

int bar(char); 
int bar(char, char);

Answer: Those functions defined following the variable definition.


28. What functions can access a local variable?
Answer: The function in which it is defined.

[x] b. make a variable visible to only one function.
[ ] c. conserve memory when a function is not executing.
[x] d. retain a value when a function is not executing.

30. In what unusual place can you use a function call when a function returns a value by reference?
