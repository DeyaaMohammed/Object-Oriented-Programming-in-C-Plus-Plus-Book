# Exercise 11

Write a program, based on the `sterling` structure of Exercise 10 in Chapter 4, that obtains from the user two money amounts in old-style British format (Â£9:19:11), adds them, and displays the result, again in old-style format. Use three functions. The first should obtain a pounds-shillings-pence value from the user and return the value as a structure of type `sterling`. The second should take two arguments of type `sterling` and return a value of the same type, which is the sum of the arguments. The third should take a sterling structure as its argument and display its value.
