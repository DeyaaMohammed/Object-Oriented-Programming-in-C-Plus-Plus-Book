/*Write a program, based on the sterling structure of Exercise 10 in Chapter 4, that
obtains from the user two money amounts in old-style British format (ï¿½9:19:11), adds
them, and displays the result, again in old-style format. Use three functions. The first
should obtain a pounds-shillings-pence value from the user and return the value as a
structure of type sterling. The second should take two arguments of type sterling and
return a value of the same type, which is the sum of the arguments. The third should take
a sterling structure as its argument and display its value.*/
