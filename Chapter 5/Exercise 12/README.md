# Exercise 12

Revise the four-function fraction calculator from Exercise 12, Chapter 4, so that it uses functions for each of the four arithmetic operations. They can be called `fadd()`, `fsub()`, `fmul()`, and `fdiv()`. Each of these functions should take two arguments of type `struct` `fraction`, and return an argument of the same type.
