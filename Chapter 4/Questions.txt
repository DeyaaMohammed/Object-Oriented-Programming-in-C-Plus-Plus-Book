Questions
1. A structure brings together a group of
[ ] a. items of the same data type.
[x] b. related data items.
[ ] c. integers with user-defined names.
[x] d. variables.

2. True or false: A structure and a class use similar syntax. (True)

3. The closing brace of a structure is followed by a ___semicolon___.

4. Write a structure specification that includes three variables—all of type int—called hrs, mins, and secs. Call this structure time.
struct time 
{ 
	int hrs; 
	int mins;
	int secs; 
};

5. True or false: A structure definition creates space in memory for a variable. (False)

6. When accessing a structure member, the identifier to the left of the dot operator is the name of
[ ] a. a structure member.
[ ] b. a structure tag.
[x] c. a structure variable.
[ ] d. the keyword struct.

7. Write a statement that sets the hrs member of the time2 structure variable equal to 11.
time2.hrs = 11;

8. If you have three variables defined to be of type struct time, and this structure contains three int members, how many bytes of memory do the variables use together?
Answer: 18 in 16-bit systems (3 structures times 3 integers times 2 bytes), or 36 in 32-bit systems.

9. Write a definition that initializes the members of time1—which is a variable of type struct time, as defined in Question 4—to hrs = 11, mins = 10, secs = 59.
time time1 = { 11, 10, 59 };

10. True or false: You can assign one structure variable to another, provided they are of the same type. (True)

11. Write a statement that sets the variable temp equal to the paw member of the dogs member of the fido variable.
temp = fido.dogs.paw;

12. An enumeration brings together a group of
[ ] a. items of different data types.
[ ] b. related data variables.
[x] c. integers with user-defined names.
[ ] d. constant values.

13. Write a statement that declares an enumeration called players with the values B1, B2, SS, B3, RF, CF, LF, P, and C.
enum players { B1, B2, SS, B3, RF, CF, LF, P, C };

14. Assuming the enum type players as declared in Question 13, define two variables joe and tom, and assign them the values LF and P, respectively.
players joe, tom; 
joe = LF; 
tom = P;

15. Assuming the statements of Questions 13 and 14, state whether each of the following statements is legal.
a. joe = QB;     	     (No)
b. tom = SS;                 (Yes)
c. LF = tom;                 (No)
d. difference = joe - tom;   (Yes)

16. The first three enumerators of an enum type are normally represented by the values ___0___, ___1___, and ___2___.

17. Write a statement that declares an enumeration called speeds with the enumerators obsolete, single, and album. Give these three names the integer values 78, 45, and 33.
enum speeds { obsolete = 78, single = 45, album = 33 };

18. State the reason that
enum isWord{ NO, YES };
is better than
enum isWord{ YES, NO };
Answer: because false should be represented by 0.
