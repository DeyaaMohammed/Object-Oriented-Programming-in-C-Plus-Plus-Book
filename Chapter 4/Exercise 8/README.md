# Exercise 8

Start with the fraction-adding program of Exercise 9 in Chapter 2, “C++ Programming Basics.” This program stores the numerator and denominator of two fractions before adding them, and may also store the answer, which is also a fraction. Modify the program so that all fractions are stored in variables of type `struct` `fraction`, whose two members are the fraction’s numerator and denominator (both type `int`). All fractionrelated data should be stored in structures of this type.
